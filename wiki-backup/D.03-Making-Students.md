# ðŸ§’ How to make Students ðŸ§’

Creating a student is easy within Stars 2 Apples. First, navigate to the Students screen, then press the "âž•" button in the top-right corner of the screen.

Each Student item consists of 4 pieces of information:

1. Photo (optional)
2. Name (required)
3. Gender
4. Age Range
5. Classroom

Though Gender and Age Range are technically required, they have no bearing on the experience of the app, except when creating schedules the app will recommend Rewards/Props that match these attributes.

Photos can be in the "jpg", "jpeg", "png", or "gif" formats, although gifs will not animate in this area.

Simply fill out the information you wish and you're ready to go.
