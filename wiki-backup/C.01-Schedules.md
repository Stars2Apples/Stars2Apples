# ðŸ—“ Schedules ðŸ—“

Schedules allow you to track
1. _**who (Students)**_
2. _**what (Rewards/Props)**_
3. _**when**_

for a given lesson.

Though it requires some redundant work (you no doubt already track _**who**_ and _**when**_ elsewhere), adding this information into Stars 2 Apples provides some in-app benefits. Doing this enables to you to:
- prepare beforehand which Rewards/Props you want to use for a given student on a given lesson
- view the student's history of previously used Rewards/Props
- see which Rewards/Props a student tends to like so that you can provide similar Rewards/Props in future lessons
