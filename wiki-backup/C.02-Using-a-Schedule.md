# ðŸ—“ How to use Schedules ðŸ—“

## Accessing your Schedule

The Schedule lives in the middle tab along the bottom of the screen.

Upon opening this tab, you will be met with a view of the current week, with the current day already selected (also underlined in the week view for ease of viewing). You can tap on a day to see they day's Class Times, and scroll left/right to view different weeks. There's also a "Today" button on the top-left of the screen to allow you to easily jump to the present day.

Days that have Class Times on them display a dot below the number of the day, so that you can easily spot which days are scheduled for lessons.

## Using your Schedules

Once you have Class Times lined up and it's time to teach your lesson, go to the Schedule Screen and select the Schedule item that you previously made for your Student at the correct time. It will open immediately to the Reward you previously selected for them, and also gives you quick access to your previously selected props!
