Stars 2 Apples provides some basic user settings to enhance and customize your experience.

Here is a light breakdown of each included setting:
1. Change App Icon
   - Allows you to select from one of our included App Icons. This has no impact on functionality and is only here for fun üôÇ 
   - "Old School" is what our Icon used to before we too succumbed to Flat Design principles üôÉ
2. Larger Thumbnail Size
   - When enabled, this increases the Thumbnail size for Rewards/Props on their respective screens. Useful if you want to be able to see more of the thumbnail when searching for your next Reward/Prop. See the following screenshots for a comparison.

3. Category List View
   - When enabled, this replaces the familiar "collection" style view (with all the thumbnails) for the Reward/Prop screens with a more compact, possibly easier to navigate list of Categories. Entering the category still displays all of the Rewards/Props in that category in the collection style with thumbnails.

4. Show Hidden Rewards/Props
   - For Rewards/Props that are built into the app, you cannot remove them, but you still have the option to hide them. This is done from the [Edit Reward/Prop](A.03-Making-Rewards#editingremoving-rewards) screen on a built-in Reward/Prop. Once the Reward/Prop is hidden, it is **_seemingly_** gone forever from view.
   - When "Show Hidden Rewards/Props" is enabled, there is a Category titled "Hidden" that will appear at the bottom of the Reward/Prop screens if there are any such hidden Reward/Prop available.

5. Reset Default Rewards/Props
   - Most of the time, the Rewards/Props that are built into Stars 2 Apples work well. Sometimes however there is a need to "reset" these built-in Rewards/Props. This can be because you updated some of the "Identity" information and now want to reset it to defaults, or perhaps because of a bad iPhone/iPad transfer (or because the app was quit during initialization), none of the images for these built-in Rewards/Props are showing up anymore. Pressing this button should take care of all of those scenarios.
   - Note that this only works for built-in Rewards/Props, not custom Rewards/Props you yourself have created.

At the bottom of the screen also is the Version number of the app (displaying here as `1.5`), copyright info, and a link to our privacy policy (TL:DR; we don't collect any personally identifiable information).
