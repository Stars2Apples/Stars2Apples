# ‚≠êÔ∏è Reward Types ‚≠êÔ∏è

Rewards are little activities that help keep your student engaged during a lesson. They vary in type, so how you use them is up to you!

Different Rewards will appeal to different students based on what their needs, interests, and ages are, so it's important to find/make/use rewards that matter to your students.

## Find a Star (FAS)

Find a Star Rewards (or "FAS" Rewards) are the most common type of Reward. They are like a little treasure hunt. The goal is to find all 5 Stars.

FAS (and many other Reward types) is a grid-based reward, in that it displays a series of "Reward Images" laid out in a grid, each hidden behind a "Cover". Covers are easily distinguishable from each other by color and/or number so that they can be named by your student as the activity progresses.

Some of these Reward Images are stars, and the rest are clipart based on the theme of the Find a Star reward that you can use for teaching moments. For example, "Farm FAS" shows different Farm Animals your student can learn/name, and "Fruit FAS" contains clipart of fruit.

At a time in the lesson of your choosing, you can allow the student to choose one or more of the Covers to turn over, revealing the Reward Image behind it. If the Reward Image is a Star, congratulations! Your student has found one of the 5 stars! If the Reward Image is not a Star, then it prompts a moment for your student to either learn or recall what the clipart's name is (for example, cow if you are using "Farm FAS").

FAS vary in how many images are laid out in the grid and how many stars each one has, but there cannot be more than 25 images, and there are usually 5 stars to find.

## Picture Prizes (PP)

"Picture Prize" Rewards (or "PP" Rewards) are another grid-based reward, with the only major difference from FAS being that PP Rewards do not have any stars to find. The fun comes from simply turning over the covers to see what's underneath! You can think of this being similar to "collecting" items as a lesson progresses, which motivates the student to return to Stars 2 Apples to earn/collect every image in the set.

## Teacher vs. Student (TvS)

"Teacher vs. Student" Rewards (or "TvS" Rewards) are another grid-based reward similar to FAS/PP, but instead of finding Stars, each Reward Image has a Point value associated to it!

As the game progresses, take turns selecting an image/cover with your student, and tally up your scores (you can use the Whiteboard feature to keep track). Whoever has more points after turning over all of the covers/images wins!

## Make a Scene

"Make a Scene" Rewards (or "MAS" Rewards) allow your and/or the student to assemble a fun scene from the background and images provides.

For example, the "Farm Scene" reward displays some farmland and a barn, and on the side of the screen is a drawer of Farm Animals that you can bring into the scene. As the lesson progresses, you can ask your student which new animal to add to the scene!

Some tips when using this reward:
* Images can be moved onto the scene by placing your finger on the image in the drawer and dragging the image onto the scene.
* Images can also be added onto the scene by tapping the image in the drawer that you want to use (which "selects" the image), and then tapping on the scene where you want to place the image. You can then deselect the image in the drawer by tapping on it again. You can also tap on a different image in the drawer to prepare to place that one instead.
* You can place as many images onto the scene as you wish.
* Once placed, you can pinch the image with two fingers to scale or rotate the image to the size and orientation that you wish. This makes for some fun interactions with students!
* To remove an image already in the scene, drag it back into the drawer.

## Matching Game

"Matching Game" Rewards (or "MG" Rewards) are another grid-based reward. As the name implies, this is a matching game where behind the covers there are reward images that you need to match (two of each reward image).

For each turn, choose a cover (the image will be revealed), and then choose a second cover (the second image will be revealed). If the two images are a match, a check mark will appear and the two images will disappear! If the images are not a match, an x will appear and the images will get covered again. Continue to play until all matches are found!

You can take turns with the student trying to match images, or have the student match images on their own.

## Picture Reveal

"Picture Reveal" Rewards (or "PR" Rewards) are another grid-based reward, except this time there's no reward images! The "reward" is the background picture, which you reveal gradually by tapping one cover at a time.

The most common way to use this reward is to have the student guess the picture as you play, but let your imagination run wild and use this reward type however you wish.

## Tic Tac Toe

"Tic Tac Toe" Rewards (or "TTT" Rewards) are basic Tic Tac Toe games, with the bonus you can use your own images in place of the "X" and the "O" for a more personalized, fun way to play.

For example, "Emojis TTT" lets you select an emoji in place of the "X" and the "O", that way it can be the "üòé" and the "üòç" emojis battling it out instead.

Once 3 of the same icon/letter are placed in a row, a victor is declared!

## Physical

"Physical" Rewards are essentially placeholders for if you have a physical, real-life reward you want to use instead of one of S2A's digital rewards. This reward is not an in-app activity, but rather a placeholder to aid you in your lesson planning.

The idea is that as you're creating your schedule within the app, if you wanted to have a placeholder within the app to remind you that you wanted to use a real-life reward that you have in your real-life classroom, you take a picture of the real-life reward and save it to the Physical Reward so that when it comes time to use the reward in your lesson, you have a photo of it and know exactly which real-life reward to use.
