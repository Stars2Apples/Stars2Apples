# ⭐️ How to make Rewards ⭐️

(For information on how each different Reward type works, see the page on [Reward Types](https://github.com/Stars2Apples/Support/wiki/A.04-Reward-Types))

Stars 2 Apples allows you to easily create custom rewards. By making your own, you can have Rewards that are hyper-specific to the units your are teaching, and even add delight by including your students' favorite cartoon or video game characters. 

Creating Rewards aims to remain simple while also offering as much customization as possible to tailor the reward to your students.

## Getting Started

To create your own reward, get started by pressing the "+" button in the top-right of the Rewards Screen.

![Create Reward 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stars2Apples/Support/main/assets/rewards-create-1.gif)

From here, you can begin filling out information by section:

- Info
   - The "Info" section contains basic information about your reward, such as the name and type.
   - Name: the name of the Reward.
   - Template Type: the type for the Reward. (For information on how each different Reward type works, see the page on [Reward Types](https://github.com/Stars2Apples/Support/wiki/A.04-Reward-Types))
   - Background: the background for your reward, if you choose to have one.
   - Orientation: select whether you want the reward to be viewed in the landscape or portrait orientation.
   - Size: because Rewards tend to use many images and even GIFs, the size of the reward can easily become large. If a reward becomes too large, it can take a long time to open, and even crash your app with an "Out of Memory" error. This field is display-only and will tell you approximately how big the file size of your reward is getting so that be aware as you create it.
- Identity
   - The "Identity" section is where you enter information used to identify, sort, and find your reward for use later.
   - "Category" is where this Reward will be located from within the main Rewards Screen.
   - "Tags" are searchable indexes that you can use to easily locate your reward when searching. You can think of these as similar to Categories, in that you can use Tags to group Rewards together, however makes the most sense to you.
   - The remaining fields allow you to specify if this Reward is more for boys or girls, or more for older or younger kids. Stars 2 Apples uses this section to suggest Rewards for your student to use later on if you use the scheduling feature.
- Thumbnail
   - For ease of use in identifying your Reward later, you need a Thumbnail. You can either take a "picture" of your Reward to use as the thumbnail within the Thumbnail Editor, or you can upload your own image instead. 

## Per-Template Customization

The remaining sections are for customizing the experience of your reward, and are specific to the Template Type:

3.  Randomize images: if you turn this on, each time you open the reward, the stars and images behind the covers will be in a different spot. If you leave this off, your images will be in the same spot each time you open the reward. (Note: covers will not be affected if this option is on or off.)

## Important Notes
- The sections other than "Info", "Identity", and "Thumbnail" are specific to the Template Type that you are using, so pay special attention to which Template Type you are using! (see [Reward Types](https://github.com/Stars2Apples/Support/wiki/A.04-Reward-Types) for more information)
- Images can be in the "jpg", "jpeg", "png", or "gif" format.
   - "gif" formatted images will animate!
   - "png" formatted images (if the file is created correctly) support transparent backgrounds. This is especially useful for Make a Scene rewards, so that your characters/images looks like they are a part of the scene, instead of having a square background.
- When using a grid-based reward (such as FAS, PR, TvS, or PP):
   - For the "Covers" section you have the option of using a Coverset. Coversets are included with the App and allow you to quickly add covers to the entire grid.
   - For the "Rewards" section you have the topic of Applying a Star. This option pulls up some included star assets for you to use in your reward for your convenience.
- If you are ever lost or confused during the creation process, press on the "i" icon next to each Section header for a breakdown of what that section is for and how to use it.
- Every field required to create a Reward is marked with a red _**(required)**_, so it's easy to spot your next piece of required information.
