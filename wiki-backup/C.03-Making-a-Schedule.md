# ðŸ—“ How to make Schedules ðŸ—“

Creating a schedule is easy within Stars 2 Apples. First, navigate to the Schedule screen, select the day you want to schedule for, then press the "+" button in the top-right corner of the screen.

Each Schedule item consists of 4 pieces of information:

1. Student (optional)
2. When (required)
3. Reward (optional)
4. Props (optional)

The "When" field is required, and everything else is option to give you the maximum amount of flexibility when creating your schedule. This way you can have a lesson consisting of only Props, only a Reward, a combination of Rewards/Props, etc. The student is optional in case you either wanted to create a student for this Class Time later, or even if you didn't want to tie these Rewards/Props to a Student at all.
