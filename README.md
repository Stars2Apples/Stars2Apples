Hi teachers! This is the Support Page, Wiki, Bug Tracker, Roadmap, and more for Stars 2 Apples.

If you've never heard of GitHub, it is a website that helps developers like myself organize our code, bugs, and what we're working on. I decided to put Stars 2 Apples' bug trackers and feature requests here instead of any other website because I am here more than I am just about any other website. So if bug reports and enhancement requests are here, then I am much more likely to see them and work on them!

I'm glad you are here! Please see the table of contents for the most common reasons you are here and how you can do them:

Table of Contents:
- Wiki/FAQs
- Reporting a Bug
- Requesting a feature/enhancement
- Checking the roadmap

## [Wiki/FAQs](https://github.com/Stars2Apples/Support/wiki)

Check out the Wiki for tutorials, FAQs and more.

The Wiki breaks down everything you need to know about Rewards, Props, Schedules, Students and more. Please search the Wiki for any questions you have before reporting a bug / opening an issue.

## [Reporting a Bug](https://github.com/Stars2Apples/Support/issues)

Thank you for letting me know about an issue you're seeing in the app! I want to make the app the best possible experience for you and all other teachers.

To submit a bug report, do the following steps:
- Click on the "issues" tab near the top of the screen
- Once on the "issues" tab, click on the green "New Issue" in the top right of the page
- Enter a name for the bug in the "title" field
- On the right side of the sceen, click on "Labels" and add the "bug" label to th issue
- Fill out your bug report according to the provided template
- Select the green "Submit new issue" button at the bottom of the text box

And I will follow up with you next chance I get!


:warning: ***NOTE: You can also look through the currently open issues and the previously closed issues to
see what's already been reported before. If an issue is submitted that had already been reported
previously, I will mark it with a `duplicate` label and link the original issue to it so that progress
can be followed in one place, and discussion surrounding the issue can be as centralized as possible.***


## [Requesting a feature/enhancement](https://github.com/Stars2Apples/Support/issues)

Thank you for sharing your ideas with me on how the app can be better for you!

To submit an enhancement/feature request, it's almost the same as submitting an issue:
- Click on the "issues" tab near the top of the screen
- Once on the "issues" tab, click on the green "New Issue" in the top right of the page
- Enter a name for the enhancement/feature request in the "title" field
- On the right side of the sceen, click on "Labels" and add the "enhancement" label to the issue
- Fill out your enhancement/feature request according to the provided template
- Select the green "Submit new issue" button at the bottom of the text box

And I will follow up with you next chance I get!

## [Checking the roadmap](https://github.com/Stars2Apples/Support/projects/4)

There is also a roadmap that you can follow to see what bugs/features are being prioritized and worked on.

To access it:
- Click on the "projects" tab near the top of the screen
- Once on the "projects" tab, select the "Roadmap" project
- There are 4 columns here that represent where a bug/feature is currently at in the development lifecycle:
  1. [Triage](https://github.com/Stars2Apples/Support/projects/4#column-12901188) - This is where new issues/enhancements go until I've triaged them (looked over them, confirmed it's valid, and committed to work on it)
  2. [To Do](https://github.com/Stars2Apples/Support/projects/4#column-12901160) - This is where issues/enhancements I've confirmed go until I can work on them
  3. [In Progress](https://github.com/Stars2Apples/Support/projects/4#column-12901161) - This is where issues/enhancements I'm currently working on go
  4. [Done](https://github.com/Stars2Apples/Support/projects/4#column-12901162) - This is where issues/enhancements go when I've finished them (code-wise, not release-wise)
