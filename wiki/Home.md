  <em>Stars 2 Apples helps online ESL teachers stay organized and helps engage students with exciting rewards and props.</em>
</p>

The app (and wiki) are organized into the following 5 sections, displayed as Tabs along the bottom of the screen:
* **Rewards**
   * Motivate your students by rewarding them with fun rewards right from your phone or tablet. You can easily create your own rewards within the app and share them with others.
* **Props**
   * Help your students learn new concepts with pictures. You can easily create your own props and organize them your own way.
* **Schedule**
   * Prepare for your classes by selecting what reward and props you want to use for each of your upcoming classes.
* **Students**
   * Add your students to the app to keep track of what rewards you use for them and any interests they have.
* **Settings**
   * Customize your experience by changing the App Icon, increasing the thumbnail size, whether to display the Rewards/Props screens in collection form or list form, and more.
