### Q: I have paid for the app already, and when I go to download the app on another device, it looks like I need to purchase the app again. Do I really have to purchase it again?

A: No!

You do not need to purchase the app again. If you have downloaded Stars 2 Apples previously on one device, and on another device you are using the same Apple ID in your App Store settings (or using one in the same Family Sharing group as the one who initially purchased the Stars 2 Apples), then you do not need to purchase the app again. 

It only _looks_ like you need to. It's a weird little thing about the App Store. We have seen and heard reports where viewing the app on the App Store from another device will *appear as though you have not yet purchased it*, but when you go to “purchase” the app, an alert appears that says something along the lines of `“You have already purchased this app. It is downloading now.”` Obviously that looks scary to try not knowing if it will charge you or not, but will work if you are correctly signed in with your Apple ID!

If you try that and you somehow are charged twice, reach out to Apple Support and explain your situation and ask for a refund (Apple handles payments on the App Store, so we can’t directly help there unfortunately) and they should be able to issue you a refund without issue.

## Reward/Prop FAQs

***

### Q: How do I edit/delete Rewards/Props?

A: Press and hold down on any Reward/Prop to bring up a context menu that will give you the option to edit/delete it.

For more information, please see the [Making Rewards](A.03-Making-Rewards#editingremoving-rewards) Section of the Wiki.

***

### Q: I accidentally hid a reward/prop I want back, how do I get it back?

A: Please see the [Show Hidden Rewards/Props](E.01-Settings#4-show-hidden-rewardsprops) section of the Wiki for more information.

***

### Q: When attempting to download a Custom Reward/Prop from a public Google Drive, I am seeing a "Too Many Redirects" error. How can I fix this?

A: This can be fixed by updating to at least version `1.5` of Stars 2 Apples.

***

### Q: I am creating Rewards, Props, Classtimes and/or Students on my iPhone/iPad, but am not seeing these sync over to my other iPhones/iPads. How do I fix this?

A: Currently Stars 2 Apples does not support syncing, but we are investigating ways to add this functionality. [Click here to see and follow progress on this Feature Request.](https://github.com/Stars2Apples/Support/issues/2)

***

### Q: I just (did a restore on my iPhone/iPad)/(transferred my account from my old iPhone/iPad to a new iPhone/iPad) and my Rewards/Props' images are missing. How do I fix this?

A: If the Rewards/Props in question are Custom Rewards/Props, then we're sorry to say that there was an issue during the restore/transfer, and there is sadly nothing that can be done to bring those images back. You will need to delete those Rewards/Props and create them again.

There has been some recent work in making the restore/transfer more reliable, so please make sure you are on the latest version of Stars 2 Apples _before_ attempting to restore/transfer.

If the Rewards/Props in question are _not_ Custom Rewards/Props and instead are the built-in Rewards/Props, then please see the [Reset Default Rewards/Props](E.01-Settings#5-reset-default-rewardsprops) section of the Wiki for more information.

## Refund FAQs

***

### Q: I'm unsatisfied with my purchase and would like a refund. 

A: We're sorry to see you go! Thanks for giving our little app a try. 

To request a refund, you will need to reach out to Apple Support directly and explain your situation. Because Apple handles all payments on apps distributed through their App Store, we unfortunately can’t help in this regard. If you reach out to Apple Support they should be able to provide you a refund without issue.
