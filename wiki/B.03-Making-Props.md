# üçé How to make Props üçé

Stars 2 Apples allows you to easily create custom Props. By making your own, you can have Props that are hyper-specific to the units your are teaching, and even add delight by including your students' favorite cartoon or video game characters.

Creating Props is much more straightforward than creating a Reward, as a prop as its core is simply an image!

## Getting Started

To create your own Prop, get started by pressing the "‚ûï" button in the top-right of the Props Screen.

From here, you can begin filling out information by section:

- Info
   - Name: the name of the Prop.
   - Size: because Props are images or GIFs, the size of the prop can easily become large. If a Prop becomes too large, it can take a long time to open, and even crash your app with an "Out of Memory" error. This field is display-only and will tell you approximately how big the file size of your Prop is getting so that be aware as you create it.
- Identity
   - The "Identity" section is where you enter information used to identify, sort, and find your Prop for use later.
   - "Category" is where this Prop will be located from within the main Props Screen.
   - "Tags" are searchable indexes that you can use to easily locate your Prop when searching. You can think of these as similar to Categories, in that you can use Tags to group Props together, however makes the most sense to you.
- Image
   1. Tap the plus sign. Take a picture of your Prop. (The thumbnail will automatically be created with this image.) 
   2. Tap "save" and your Prop will be added to the app.

## Important Notes
- Images can be in the "jpg", "jpeg", "png", or "gif" format.
   - "gif" formatted images will animate!
   - "png" formatted images (if the file is created correctly) support transparent backgrounds.
- If you are ever lost or confused during the creation process, press on the "i" icon next to each Section header for a breakdown of what that section is for and how to use it.
- Every field required to create a Prop is marked with a red _**(required)**_, so it's easy to spot your next piece of required information.

## Editing/Removing Rewards

To edit or remote an existing Prop, press and hold on the Prop to bring up a context menu.

If the Prop came with the app, then you will be given the option to edit some of the "Identity" information to better suit your workflow.

If the Prop is a Custom Prop, then you have full control over editing any of the information about the Prop, and also have the option to delete it.
