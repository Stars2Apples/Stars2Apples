## Sharing

Once you have created your own Custom Rewards and Props, you might be inclined to share it others, or to store it somewhere outside the app for you to access later. You're in luck! Stars 2 Apples lets you export/share your Custom Reward/Prop outside of the app.

You'll know that a file is a Stars 2 Apples custom Reward/Prop if the file extension is `.s2a`. Note that not any file named with that extension can be opened by the app -- it must also be formatted correctly.

Also note that while Stars 2 Apples lets you export these files, the files are written in a custom format and currently can only be read by the Stars 2 Apples app itself. 

To share:
1. Create your custom Reward/Prop
2. Press and hold on the custom Reward/Prop so that the context menu appears
3. Press "share"
4. This will open the familiar Action Sheet, wherein you can select to email, copy, or otherwise share your custom Reward/Prop with yourself or others.

## Downloading

Just as you can export custom Rewards/Props, you can also import them.

To import, there's a couple different ways to go about it:
1. You can download or copy the file onto your iPhone/iPad the same way you would any other file.
   - This could be done via email, AirDrop, or downloading from a Web Browser
   - Once that's done, within Web downloads folder or elsewhere in the "Files" app, you can tap on the `.s2a` file
   - Stars 2 Apples will attempt to import the file
2. If you host your custom Rewards/Props on Google Drive and make the file have _**publicly accessible permissions**_, then you can download the file from within the app.
   - To do so, press the download button (looks a bit like "‚¨áÔ∏è") next to the "‚ûï" button on either the Rewards or Props screen
   - In the text field, enter the url of the publicly accessible File on Google Drive
   - Press "Save" and Stars 2 Apples will attempt to import the file
