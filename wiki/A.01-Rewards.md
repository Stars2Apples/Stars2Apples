# ⭐️ Rewards ⭐️

(THIS IS A TEST, WE'LL SEE IF IT WORKS)

Rewards are little activities that help keep your student engaged during a lesson. They vary in type, so how you use them is up to you!

Different Rewards will appeal to different students based on what their needs, interests, and ages are, so it's important to find/make/use rewards that matter to your students.
