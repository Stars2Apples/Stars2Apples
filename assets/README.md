Assets made using Paul Hudson (and other's) incredible work on [ControlRoom](https://github.com/twostraws/ControlRoom) to create the GIFs from the simulator.

Using the following command form the equally awesome `imagemagick` lib to convert the output gif into a looping one:
```
convert -delay 100 -loop 0 reward-pp-fruit.gif reward-pp-fruit.gif
```
